Null Values
    a. Some cols have more than 81% of the values as null. Cannot fill these values without knowing about the cols. (with backfill for sequence, etc.)
    b. Some cols have ~13% of the values as null.

    For these cols with null values, we cannot fill values (using, backfill, mean, mode, etc.) because no info about the cols are present.
    Better to get rid of cols with high null values.
    If the null values are less than 10%. We can consider experimenting. 
    1. Experiment 1 : Fill those values and build model1. And remove those cols and build model2 and have a avg. voting model.
    2. Experiment 2 : Fill those values and build model1. And remove those rows (incase of less null) and build model2 and have a avg. voting model.
    3. Experiment 3 : Simply fill/remove the col values and build model.
    4. Experiment 4 : Try filling values and see its impact on model.
    
    Not considering removing rows, since data points are less.





Try going towards ensemble because the problem looks like bias. And also can be variance.

1. Data Preprocessing
    a. Null Values
        data1 : Dropping cols with more than 50% null. And filling the rest. Median for Numeric, mode for cat.
        
    b. Imbalanced Dataset
        data1 : Oversampling using SMOTE
        data2 : Using robust algo like ensemble
